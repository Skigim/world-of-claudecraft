# Frontend Modernization v0.16.0 (feature/frontend-modernization-v016, off release/v0.16.0)

Make World of ClaudeCraft's UI clean, scalable, responsive (mobile-landscape first), and fast on
the big-3 browsers WITHOUT a JS framework: stay vanilla HTML/CSS/TS and let the modern web platform
plus one build tool (Lightning CSS) do the work. This is the definitive version of the refactor,
rebuilt on `release/v0.16.0` and EXPANDED beyond the original: it extracts the giant inline
`<style>` blocks into a real CSS pipeline with tiered tokens and `@layer`, ships the graphics-tier
HUD effects resolver, extracts the remaining cold windows out of the 14,377-line `hud.ts` behind
`IWorld`, AND for the first time extracts the per-frame HUD layer (bars, frames, nameplates,
minimap, FCT, action bar) into testable cores + write-elided painters, then drives per-element
graphics-quality tiering off the static preset. All behind the project's determinism,
server-authority, i18n, and per-frame perf gates.

This is a RESTART of the completed `feature/frontend-modernization` (FB) packet, which targeted the
older `release/v0.14.1`. The restart decision (Option B) and its evidence are in
`feasibility-v0.16.0.md`; the why-and-scope is in `v016-restart-direction.md`. FB is a read-only
SOURCE: most of its artifacts port forward file-for-file (see `state.md` "Provenance" and the
"Reuse from FB" section of `v016-recon-and-packet.md`).

This packet is the SINGLE source of truth for the frontend direction on v0.16.0.

## Start here

Each phase is its own fresh Claude Code session (Opus 4.8, xhigh effort). To begin a phase, open
its `phase-NN-*.md` and paste the Starter Prompt into a new session. Run the QA pass
(`qa-checklist.md`, instantiated for the phase) immediately after each implementation phase. Never
skip QA. The packet was DEEP-REVIEWED and RESTRUCTURED 2026-06-24 (18 -> 30 phases via sub-letter
splits) so each phase fits well under the ~40% Opus-degradation ceiling INCLUDING its QA pass plus
in-session remediation of every finding. See the OLD -> NEW map and the locked decisions in
`state.md`.

## Index

Cross-cutting docs (decision + design lineage):
- `feasibility-v0.16.0.md` - the Option B verdict (restart, not merge) with the merge dry-run.
- `v016-restart-direction.md` - the expanded scope + the process learnings (smaller phases, perf
  gates).
- `v016-recon-and-packet.md` - the deep line-number recon of v0.16.0's frontend. The LINE-NUMBER
  source, not the authoritative plan: its 16-phase table is SUPERSEDED by the 30-phase ledger in
  `state.md` wherever they differ.
- `state.md` - locked decisions, the OLD -> NEW phase map, canonical workflow, validation matrix,
  review dispatch matrix, the 30-phase ledger. THE authoritative source the phase files elaborate.
  LOADED FIRST by every phase.
- `progress.md` - status table + per-phase deliverable checklists.
- `qa-checklist.md` - whole-feature integration QA matrix + the per-phase QA starter.

## Non-negotiables (full detail in state.md)

Vanilla only (one new devDep: Lightning CSS). The per-frame HUD stays framework-free with a hard
perf gate; per-frame painters route every DOM write through the existing write-elision cache (the
four writers plus the P10a `setStyleProp`/`toggleClass` extension). HUD extraction is
presentation-only (consume V16's already-extended `IWorld`; one painter consumes the paged
`leaderboard()`). New pure cores stay DOM/Three-free, deterministic, AND parity-tested against both
a Sim-shaped and a ClientWorld-mirror-shaped `IWorld` stub. Graphics-tier UI is driven from the
static preset, never the FPS governor. WCAG 2.2 AA chrome + the no-magic-values painter guard are
built IN per window/element phase (not deferred to P15); canvas painters resolve tokens via
`getComputedStyle` once per redraw. Responsive/mobile is gated by the V16 `mobile_*` E2E scripts,
not just preserved; the IN-GAME view is landscape-only (the `#rotate-device` overlay handles portrait,
decision 16a) while the shell/guide/admin stay portrait-capable. New control labels go in the
English-only `hud_chrome.ts`. Commit with explicit
paths (shared worktree). No em dashes, en dashes, or emojis anywhere.
